# Restore Point Instructions

## Current Safe State âœ…

**Date Created**: 2025-10-09
**Commit**: `d98a3e1` - "Add plan for unified active call display across all users"
**Git Tag**: `working-realtime-sync-v1`
**Backup Branch**: `backup/before-unified-call-display`

### What's Working Right Now
âœ… **Realtime sync is fully functional** - All users see active calls instantly without refresh
âœ… **Ring cancel events work** - Ghost incoming calls are cleared properly
âœ… **Parking lot works perfectly** - Instant sync when calls are parked/unparked
âœ… **Multi-agent ring works** - All available agents see incoming calls
âœ… **Transfer works** - Calls transfer correctly between agents
âœ… **RLS properly configured** - Disabled on voip_users for realtime events
âœ… **Database columns present** - current_call_phone_number, current_call_answered_at exist

### What We're About to Change
ðŸ”„ **Unified active call display** - Make all users see the same rich call panel

## How to Restore (If Something Goes Wrong)

### Option 1: Quick Rollback (Recommended)

If you just made changes and need to undo them:

```bash
# 1. Discard all uncommitted changes
git checkout .
git clean -fd

# 2. Go back to the last safe commit
git reset --hard working-realtime-sync-v1

# 3. Force push if you already pushed bad changes
git push --force-with-lease origin main
```

### Option 2: Restore from Backup Branch

If you need to completely restore from the backup:

```bash
# 1. Switch to backup branch
git checkout backup/before-unified-call-display

# 2. Create a new main branch from backup
git branch -D main
git checkout -b main

# 3. Force push to replace main
git push --force-with-lease origin main
```

### Option 3: Selective File Restore

If only specific files broke:

```bash
# Restore AgentCard.tsx from safe point
git checkout working-realtime-sync-v1 -- components/super-admin/calling/AgentCard.tsx

# Restore calling page from safe point
git checkout working-realtime-sync-v1 -- app/super-admin/calling/page.tsx

# Commit the restoration
git add .
git commit -m "Restore files to working state"
```

---

## Verification After Restore

After restoring, verify everything works:

### 1. Check Git State
```bash
git log --oneline -3
# Should show:
# d98a3e1 Add plan for unified active call display across all users
# d47bb1c Document realtime sync fix with comprehensive inline comments
# ebf65ae Fix: Broadcast ring_cancel when call ends
```

### 2. Check Files Exist
```bash
ls -la REALTIME-SYNC-FIX.md
ls -la HOW-TO-FIX.md
ls -la components/super-admin/calling/AgentCard.tsx
```

### 3. Test Realtime Sync
- [ ] Open two browser windows (Doug and Rhonda)
- [ ] Doug answers incoming call
- [ ] Rhonda's screen shows Doug on call **instantly** (no refresh)
- [ ] Doug ends call
- [ ] Both screens clear **instantly**

### 4. Test Ring Cancel
- [ ] Incoming call rings both Doug and Rhonda
- [ ] Doug answers
- [ ] Rhonda's incoming call UI clears immediately (no ghost call)

### 5. Test Parking Lot
- [ ] Doug parks a call
- [ ] Rhonda sees it in parking lot **instantly**
- [ ] Rhonda retrieves the call
- [ ] Doug sees it disappear from parking lot **instantly**

## Key Files in This Safe State

### Database Schema
- âœ… `voip_users` has `current_call_phone_number` column
- âœ… `voip_users` has `current_call_answered_at` column
- âœ… `voip_users` has RLS **DISABLED**

### Backend
- âœ… `app/api/twilio/update-user-call/route.ts` - Broadcasts ring_cancel, updates voip_users
- âœ… All realtime sync fixes with inline comments

### Frontend
- âœ… `app/super-admin/calling/page.tsx` - Subscriptions to voip_users, ring_events, active_calls
- âœ… `components/super-admin/calling/AgentCard.tsx` - Current working display logic
- âœ… `lib/stores/callActiveStore.ts` - Store syncing active calls

### Documentation
- âœ… `REALTIME-SYNC-FIX.md` - Complete documentation of all three fixes
- âœ… `HOW-TO-FIX.md` - Quick start guide
- âœ… `UNIFIED-ACTIVE-CALL-PLAN.md` - Plan for upcoming changes

## What NOT to Restore (Keep New Changes)

If you restore but want to keep certain new improvements:

**Good to keep (if working)**:
- New UI components that don't break functionality
- Documentation improvements
- Code comments
- Styling changes

**Must restore if broken**:
- Subscription code in `calling/page.tsx`
- Store logic in `callActiveStore.ts`
- API endpoint `update-user-call/route.ts`
- Any realtime sync logic

---

## Emergency Contact Points

### Check if Realtime Sync is Broken

**Symptom**: Active calls only show after page refresh

**Diagnosis**:
```bash
# 1. Check RLS is disabled
node diagnose-realtime.js
# Should show: âœ… SUCCESS! ANON client CAN receive realtime events!

# 2. Check columns exist
node test-voip-users-update.js
# Should show: current_call_phone_number and current_call_answered_at
```

**Fix**: Restore `update-user-call/route.ts` and subscription code

### Check if Ring Cancel is Broken

**Symptom**: Ghost incoming calls after someone answers

**Diagnosis**: Look for ring_cancel broadcast in server logs when call ends

**Fix**: Restore `update-user-call/route.ts` lines 252-270 (ring_cancel broadcast)

## Testing Script (After Restore)

Run this complete test to verify everything works:

```bash
# Terminal 1 - Start dev server
npm run dev

# Browser 1 - Doug (dougallen1020@gmail.com)
# Browser 2 - Rhonda (rhonda@example.com)

# Test 1: Incoming call sync
# - Make test call
# - Both should see incoming call
# - One answers
# - Other's UI clears immediately âœ…

# Test 2: Active call sync
# - Doug answers call
# - Rhonda sees "Doug: On Call" immediately âœ…
# - Doug ends call
# - Both screens clear immediately âœ…

# Test 3: Ring cancel
# - Incoming call rings both
# - Doug answers
# - Rhonda's incoming call UI disappears (no ghost) âœ…

# Test 4: Parking lot
# - Doug parks a call
# - Rhonda sees it in parking lot instantly âœ…
# - Rhonda drags to her card
# - Doug sees it disappear from parking lot âœ…
```

## Success Criteria

After restore, ALL of these must be true:

âœ… No TypeScript errors (`npm run build` succeeds)
âœ… Realtime sync works (no refresh needed)
âœ… Ring cancel clears ghost calls
âœ… Parking lot syncs instantly
âœ… No console errors in browser
âœ… No 500 errors in server logs
âœ… Database columns exist (check with test script)
âœ… RLS disabled on voip_users (check with diagnose script)

## Notes

- The backup branch will remain in the repository forever (don't delete it!)
- The tag `working-realtime-sync-v1` is immutable (safe reference point)
- Main branch can be force-pushed if needed (we have backups)
- All diagnostic scripts are in the repository root

**Remember**: The realtime sync took days to fix. Don't delete these restore points!
