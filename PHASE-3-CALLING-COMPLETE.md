# Phase 3: Twilio Calling Integration - COMPLETE âœ…

## What We Built

### 1. Call Management API Routes

#### `/api/calls/initiate` - Start a Call
- Super admin initiates call to an agent
- Creates call record in database with status 'ringing'
- Sets agent availability to false
- Returns call ID

#### `/api/calls/answer` - Accept a Call
- Agent accepts incoming call
- Updates call status to 'in-progress'
- Records start time

#### `/api/calls/reject` - Decline a Call
- Agent rejects incoming call
- Updates call status to 'no-answer'
- Sets agent back to available

#### `/api/calls/end` - Hang Up
- Either party ends the call
- Calculates call duration
- Updates status to 'completed'
- Sets agent back to available

### 2. Agent Dashboard Enhancements

#### Real-Time Call Subscriptions
- Listens for incoming calls (INSERT on calls table)
- Listens for call status changes (UPDATE on calls table)
- Automatically shows/hides call UI based on status

#### IncomingCallAlert Component
- Full-screen overlay when call comes in
- Shows caller information
- 30-second auto-reject timer
- Accept/Reject buttons
- Animated pulsing effect

#### ActiveCallPanel Component
- Live call duration timer
- Mute/Unmute toggle
- Hold/Resume button
- Notes section
- Hangup button
- Professional call interface

### 3. Super Admin Calling Dashboard

#### Call Initiation
- "Call Agent" button on each agent card
- Only enabled for available agents
- Shows success/error messages
- Auto-refreshes agent list after call

#### Real-Time Updates
- Agent cards update when availability changes
- Shows when agents go on call
- Stats update in real-time

## How It Works

### Call Flow:

```
1. SUPER ADMIN ACTION:
   - Clicks "Call Agent" on available agent card
   - POST /api/calls/initiate
   - Call record created with status='ringing'
   - Agent set to unavailable

2. AGENT NOTIFICATION (Real-time via Supabase):
   - Agent dashboard detects new call via subscription
   - IncomingCallAlert overlay appears
   - 30-second timer starts

3. AGENT ACCEPTS:
   - Clicks "Accept" button
   - POST /api/calls/answer
   - Call status â†’ 'in-progress'
   - ActiveCallPanel appears
   - Timer starts counting

4. CALL IN PROGRESS:
   - Live duration counter
   - Mute/Hold controls available
   - Either party can hang up

5. CALL ENDS:
   - Hangup button clicked
   - POST /api/calls/end
   - Duration calculated and saved
   - Agent set back to available
   - UI returns to normal
```

## Database Tables Used

### calls
- `id` - Call ID
- `from_number` - Caller (e.g., "Admin Dashboard")
- `to_number` - Recipient
- `assigned_to` - Agent user ID
- `status` - ringing | in-progress | completed | no-answer
- `started_at` - When call was answered
- `ended_at` - When call ended
- `duration` - Call length in seconds
- `direction` - outbound | inbound

### voip_users
- `is_available` - Boolean toggle
- Updated when call starts/ends

## Testing the System

### Step 1: Create Test Agent
1. Login as super admin (dougallen22@icloud.com / test123)
2. Go to Super Admin Dashboard
3. Click "ðŸ“ž Calling Dashboard"
4. Click "+ Add Agent"
5. Create agent:
   - Email: test@agent.com
   - Password: test123
   - Name: Test Agent

### Step 2: Setup Agent Dashboard
1. Open new browser window (incognito)
2. Go to http://localhost:3000/login
3. Login as agent (test@agent.com / test123)
4. You'll be redirected to /agent/dashboard
5. Toggle availability ON (green switch)

### Step 3: Make a Call
1. Back in super admin window
2. Find the agent card (should show "Available")
3. Click "Call Agent" button
4. Agent window will show incoming call alert!

### Step 4: Answer Call
1. In agent window, click "Accept"
2. ActiveCallPanel appears with live timer
3. Try mute/hold buttons
4. Click "End Call" to hang up

### Step 5: Verify
- Agent should be available again
- Call should be saved in database
- Both dashboards should update in real-time

## Recent Fixes (October 8, 2025)

### Issue 1: Ngrok URL Configuration
**Problem**: After computer restart, ngrok generated new URL causing:
- Twilio Error 11200 (HTTP retrieval failure)
- Park call failures
- Application errors on incoming calls

**Root Cause**: Old ngrok URL (`https://8336d5b13c1c.ngrok-free.app`) was hardcoded in:
1. Twilio phone number webhook configuration
2. `app/api/twilio/park-call/route.ts` fallback code (lines 67-68)

**Fix Applied**:
1. Added `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` environment variable to `.env.local`
2. Updated Twilio phone number webhook via API:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST "https://api.twilio.com/2010-04-01/Accounts/{SID}/IncomingPhoneNumbers/{PN_SID}.json" \
     -u "{SID}:{AUTH_TOKEN}" \
     -d "VoiceUrl=https://8e636ff86b1b.ngrok-free.app/api/twilio/voice" \
     -d "VoiceMethod=POST"
   ```
3. Removed hardcoded URLs from park-call API endpoint

**Current ngrok URL**: `https://8e636ff86b1b.ngrok-free.app`

### Issue 2: Stale Parked Call in Database
**Problem**: Old completed call stuck in `parked_calls` table causing:
- "Call has already ended (completed)" error on page refresh
- Attempted to unpark a call that already disconnected

**Root Cause**: Test call from previous session left in database with status "completed"

**Fix Applied**: Cleared `parked_calls` table via Supabase REST API:
```bash
curl -X DELETE 'https://zcosbiwvstrwmyioqdjw.supabase.co/rest/v1/parked_calls?...'
```

### Issue 3: Centralized Incoming Call Bar Appearing for Transfer/Unpark Operations
**Problem**: Centralized incoming call bar incorrectly appeared when:
1. Dragging call from parking lot to agent (unpark operation)
2. Using Transfer button to transfer call to another agent
- Should ONLY show for multi-agent ring calls from external sources
- Transfer/unpark operations should ONLY show transfer card inside target agent's card

**Root Cause**: React state timing issue
- When unpark operation starts, `setPendingTransferTo(agentId)` is called
- Previous call's disconnect event triggers cleanup: `setPendingTransferTo(null)`
- Cleanup runs BEFORE the new incoming call event fires
- New call arrives with `pendingTransferTo === null`
- Incorrectly triggers multi-agent ring instead of transfer

**Fix Applied** (October 8, 2025):
1. Added `pendingTransferToRef = useRef<string | null>(null)` to persist value across renders
2. Modified incoming call handler to check `pendingTransferToRef.current` instead of state
3. Updated transfer/unpark handlers to set both state AND ref:
   ```typescript
   setPendingTransferTo(targetAgentId)
   pendingTransferToRef.current = targetAgentId
   ```
4. Modified cleanup logic to NOT clear the ref (only cleared after processing transfer)
5. Ref persists across renders, preventing stale cleanup from clearing the target

**Files Modified**:
- `app/super-admin/calling/page.tsx` (lines 46, 307-334, 373-378, 503-504, 521, 537, 672, 698)

**Result**:
âœ… Centralized bar ONLY shows for multi-agent ring (external calls)
âœ… Transfer/unpark operations ONLY show blue transfer card in target agent's card
âœ… No timing issues with state cleanup

### Issue 4: Delayed UI Feedback When Unparking Calls
**Problem**: When dragging call from parking lot to agent card:
- User had to wait 2-3 seconds before seeing any visual feedback
- No indication that the unpark operation started
- Confusing UX - appeared like nothing happened initially
- Real call would eventually appear, but delay was jarring

**Root Cause**:
- UI only updated after API call completed AND Twilio sent incoming call event
- Sequence: drag â†’ API call (2s) â†’ Twilio processes (1s) â†’ incoming call event â†’ UI update
- Total delay: 2-3 seconds before user sees any feedback

**Fix Applied** (October 8, 2025):
1. Added `optimisticTransferMap` state to show immediate UI feedback
2. Set optimistic state INSTANTLY when drag completes (before API call)
3. Optimistic UI shows blue card with "Transferring call..." and spinner
4. Clear optimistic UI when real incoming call arrives or on error
5. Seamless transition: optimistic UI â†’ real transfer card with Answer/Decline

**Implementation**:
```typescript
// In handleDragEnd (unpark operation):
// 1. Show optimistic UI IMMEDIATELY
setOptimisticTransferMap({
  [newAgentId]: {
    callerNumber: callerNumber,
    isLoading: true
  }
})

// 2. Make API call (takes 2-3 seconds)
await fetch('/api/twilio/unpark-call', ...)

// 3. In incoming call handler - clear optimistic when real call arrives
setIncomingCallMap(newMap)
setOptimisticTransferMap({}) // Replace optimistic with real
```

**Files Modified**:
- `app/super-admin/calling/page.tsx` (lines 53, 676-682, 713, 723, 329, 894)
- `components/super-admin/calling/AgentCard.tsx` (lines 34-37, 59, 168-188)

**Result**:
âœ… Instant visual feedback when drag completes
âœ… "Transferring call..." appears immediately with spinner
âœ… Smooth transition to real transfer card when ready
âœ… Much better UX - no confusing delays

## New Feature: Call Transfer (October 8, 2025)

### Implementation
**Click-based transfer workflow**:
1. Agent has active call
2. Click "Transfer" button in call card (blue button)
3. Transfer mode activates - purple banner appears at top
4. Available agent cards highlight in purple with "Click to transfer call here"
5. Click target agent card
6. Caller hears "Transferring your call now"
7. Target agent receives transfer call (blue card with Answer/Decline)
8. Target agent answers - two-way audio established
9. Original agent's call disconnects automatically

### Files Created
- `components/super-admin/calling/TransferButton.tsx` - Reusable transfer button
- `app/api/twilio/transfer-call/route.ts` - Transfer API endpoint

### Files Modified
1. `app/super-admin/calling/page.tsx`
   - Removed centralized incoming call bar
   - Added transfer state (`transferMode`)
   - Added transfer handlers (`handleInitiateTransfer`, `handleCancelTransfer`, `handleTransferToAgent`)
   - Added transfer mode banner with purple styling
   - Wired transfer callbacks to AgentCard

2. `components/super-admin/calling/AgentCard.tsx`
   - Added `isTransferTarget` and `onClick` props
   - Added `onTransfer` callback prop
   - Added purple border/background when transfer target
   - Added "Click to transfer call here" indicator
   - Passed transfer callbacks to call cards

3. `components/super-admin/calling/DraggableCallCard.tsx`
   - Added `onTransfer` prop
   - Added Transfer button (appears before End Call button)

4. `components/super-admin/calling/MultiCallCard.tsx`
   - Added `onTransfer` prop
   - Added Transfer button (only shows for selected/active call)

### Transfer API (`/api/twilio/transfer-call`)
**How it works**:
1. Receives browser client call SID from frontend
2. Fetches call from Twilio to get parent PSTN call SID
3. Verifies PSTN call is still active
4. Generates TwiML to ring target agent's browser
5. Redirects PSTN call to target agent using inline TwiML
6. Returns success - frontend sets `pendingTransferTo` state
7. When target agent's browser rings, only shows to that agent (not multi-agent ring)

**Key Implementation Detail**: Uses `call.parentCallSid` to find PSTN leg, then redirects using inline TwiML (not URL-based like parking)
