### Components Built:
- `app/super-admin/calling/page.tsx` - Main calling dashboard (27KB+)
- `components/super-admin/calling/AgentCard.tsx` - Agent availability & call display
- `components/super-admin/calling/DraggableCallCard.tsx` - Draggable call component

- `components/super-admin/calling/IncomingCallCard.tsx` - Orange card for incoming calls
- `components/super-admin/calling/TransferCallCard.tsx` - Blue card for transferred calls

### API Routes Built:
- `app/api/twilio/token/route.ts` - Generate Twilio tokens
- `app/api/twilio/transfer-call/route.ts` - Transfer calls between agents
- `app/api/saas-users/route.ts` - User management
- `app/api/saas-users/availability/route.ts` - Update agent availability

### Latest Session Completed (October 8, 2025):
**Fixed: Separate UI for Incoming vs Transfer Calls**

**Problem**:
- When dragging a parked call to an agent, the system showed orange "Incoming Call" cards (meant for new calls) instead of a transfer-specific UI
- Centralized incoming call section appeared for both incoming calls AND transferred calls
- Confusing UX - couldn't distinguish between a new call ringing vs a transferred call

**Solution Implemented**:
1. **Created Two New Components**:
   - `IncomingCallCard.tsx` - Orange, pulsing card for multi-agent simultaneous ring (visual only, no buttons)
   - `TransferCallCard.tsx` - Blue card with Answer/Decline buttons for transferred calls

2. **Updated AgentCard Logic**:
   - Conditionally renders `IncomingCallCard` when `!onAnswerCall` (multi-agent ring)
   - Conditionally renders `TransferCallCard` when `onAnswerCall && onDeclineCall` (transfer)

3. **Added isTransfer Flag**:
   - Added `isTransfer: boolean` to `incomingCallMap` type definition
   - Set `isTransfer: true` when unparking call to specific agent
   - Set `isTransfer: false` for multi-agent simultaneous ring

4. **Fixed Centralized Card Logic**:
   - Added `!incomingCallMap[currentUserId].isTransfer` check on line 688
   - Prevents centralized orange card from showing for transfer calls

5. **Fixed State Management**:
   - Added `setIncomingCallMap({})` when parking call to clear lingering UI
   - Fixed `originalAgentId: currentUserId || undefined` for TypeScript compatibility

**Files Modified**:
- `/app/super-admin/calling/page.tsx` (lines 44, 502, 508, 688)
- `/components/super-admin/calling/AgentCard.tsx` (lines 144-156)
- `/components/super-admin/calling/IncomingCallCard.tsx` (NEW)
- `/components/super-admin/calling/TransferCallCard.tsx` (NEW)
- `/next.config.js` (reverted to default config)

**Testing Required**:
1. Call the number â†’ Should see orange "Incoming Call" cards on ALL available agents
2. Answer call and park it â†’ Orange cards should disappear
3. Drag parked call to specific agent â†’ Should see ONLY blue "Transferred Call" card in that agent's card
4. No centralized orange card should appear during transfer
