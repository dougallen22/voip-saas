# Testing Claim-Call Flow

## Current Problem
ALL calls remain `status='ringing'` and `assigned_to=null` in the database.
This means the claim-call API is NOT being executed when calls are answered.

## Test Steps

### 1. Check if latest code is deployed
- Latest commit: 067acae "Fix TypeScript error - add userIdRef for event handlers"
- Check Vercel deployment status

### 2. Test claim-call API directly
Open browser console when you answer a call and look for:
```
üìû Claiming call in database: { callSid: "CAxxxx", agentId: "uuid" }
‚úÖ Call claimed in database - all dashboards will now sync!
```

If you DON'T see these logs, the code isn't deployed yet.

### 3. Manual test of claim-call API
You can test the API manually with curl after making a call:

```bash
# Get the most recent call SID from database
curl -X POST https://voip-saas.vercel.app/api/twilio/claim-call \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"callSid":"CAb0c92d4d6919bc3f2ed36b3e38a9607f","agentId":"1781c3ad-b7bb-46d3-bce7-e098ae97e8a0"}'
```

This should return `{"success":true}` and update the database.

### 4. Verify database after manual test
```sql
SELECT id, status, assigned_to, current_call_id
FROM calls
WHERE twilio_call_sid = 'CAb0c92d4d6919bc3f2ed36b3e38a9607f';

SELECT id, current_call_id
FROM voip_users
WHERE id = '1781c3ad-b7bb-46d3-bce7-e098ae97e8a0';
```

Should show:
- calls.assigned_to = agent ID
- calls.status = 'active'
- voip_users.current_call_id = call ID

## Expected Flow (When Fixed)

1. Call comes in ‚Üí Twilio rings both browsers
2. Doug clicks green "Accept" button
3. Twilio fires 'accept' event in Doug's browser
4. useTwilioDevice hook calls /api/twilio/claim-call
5. API updates database:
   - calls.assigned_to = Doug
   - calls.status = 'active'
   - voip_users.current_call_id = call_id
6. Supabase Realtime broadcasts UPDATE to Rhonda's browser
7. Rhonda's screen shows Doug on call

## Why It's Not Working

Possible causes:
1. ‚ùå Vercel hasn't deployed latest code yet (067acae)
2. ‚ùå Browser cache - need hard refresh (Cmd+Shift+R)
3. ‚ùå The 'accept' event isn't firing
4. ‚ùå The fetch call is failing silently
5. ‚ùå CORS or auth issue with the API

## Next Steps

1. Wait for Vercel deployment to complete
2. Hard refresh BOTH browsers (Cmd+Shift+R)
3. Make a new call
4. Check browser console for claim-call logs
5. If still not working, I need to see the console logs to debug further
