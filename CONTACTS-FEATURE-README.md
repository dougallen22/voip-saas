## Database Setup

### Option 1: Run TypeScript Script (Recommended)
```bash
npx ts-node scripts/setup-contacts-table.ts
```

### Option 2: Manual SQL Execution

If the script doesn't work, run this SQL in your Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- Create contacts table
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS contacts (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  organization_id UUID REFERENCES organizations(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  business_name TEXT,
  first_name TEXT NOT NULL,
  last_name TEXT NOT NULL,
  address TEXT,
  state VARCHAR(2),
  zip VARCHAR(10),
  phone TEXT NOT NULL,
  email TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),
  created_by_user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE SET NULL
);

-- Create indexes for performance
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_contacts_organization_id ON contacts(organization_id);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_contacts_phone ON contacts(phone);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_contacts_name ON contacts(first_name, last_name);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_contacts_created_at ON contacts(created_at DESC);

-- Create trigger function
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION update_contacts_updated_at()
RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
BEGIN
  NEW.updated_at = NOW();
  RETURN NEW;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;

-- Create trigger
DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS contacts_updated_at_trigger ON contacts;
CREATE TRIGGER contacts_updated_at_trigger
  BEFORE UPDATE ON contacts
  FOR EACH ROW
  EXECUTE FUNCTION update_contacts_updated_at();

-- Enable RLS
ALTER TABLE contacts ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- RLS Policies
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view contacts from their organization" ON contacts;
CREATE POLICY "Users can view contacts from their organization"
  ON contacts FOR SELECT
  USING (
    organization_id IN (
      SELECT organization_id FROM voip_users WHERE id = auth.uid()
    )
  );

DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can create contacts in their organization" ON contacts;
CREATE POLICY "Users can create contacts in their organization"
  ON contacts FOR INSERT
  WITH CHECK (
    organization_id IN (
      SELECT organization_id FROM voip_users WHERE id = auth.uid()
    )
  );

DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can update contacts in their organization" ON contacts;
CREATE POLICY "Users can update contacts in their organization"
  ON contacts FOR UPDATE
  USING (
    organization_id IN (
      SELECT organization_id FROM voip_users WHERE id = auth.uid()
    )
  );

DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can delete contacts in their organization" ON contacts;
CREATE POLICY "Users can delete contacts in their organization"
  ON contacts FOR DELETE
  USING (
    organization_id IN (
      SELECT organization_id FROM voip_users WHERE id = auth.uid()
    )
  );
```

## Architecture Notes

### Data Flow
```
User Action → API Route → Supabase → RLS Check → Database
                                   ↓
                            Real-time Channel
                                   ↓
                            UI Updates Automatically
```

### Call Integration
```
Contact Card → Click Call → Twilio Device → Outbound Call
Contact Details → Click Call → Twilio Device → Outbound Call
Incoming Call → Banner (All Pages) → Accept → Active Call
```

### Security Model
- All data scoped to organization_id
- RLS policies prevent cross-org access
- Auth required for all endpoints
- Server-side validation on all inputs
